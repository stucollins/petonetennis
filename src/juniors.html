                    We have a large number of enthusiastic juniors aged from 5 to 18 years old, and cater for both
                    beginners, and also those wanting to play interclub.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Being a smaller club means we get to know our juniors personally, and provide a friendly supportive
                    atmosphere. We always welcome new players to our club!

                    These are held every Saturday morning (weather permitting) from early September to mid
                    December, and February to the end of March (approx). There are three sessions, split by age/ability as follows:
                    <br/><br/>
                                <table>
                                    <tr><td>5 to 8 year olds</td><td>8.30 to 9.30am</td></tr>

                                    <tr><td>11 years + and all interclub players</td><td>10.45am to 12.15pm</td></tr>
                                </table>
                                <p><b>Please note that session times may be changed depending on player numbers.</b></p>

                    <p>For the first two sessions, subject to weather conditions, we will be running the Hot Shots programme – this will allow the players to spend more time hitting the ball and practising tennis skills, as we use smaller courts with lower compression balls.
                    </p>

                    <p>For the older and interclub players, full courts will be used with normal balls</p>

                    <p><b>Gary Nelson</b> and <b>Lewis Bazalo</b> are our two professional coaches who run our Saturday morning coaching sessions and Tuesday afternoon interclub team practices. Their skill, patience and passion for tennis is a real asset to our Club. We also have <b>Emily Dine</b> and <b>Nicole Brown</b> as our assistant coaches on Saturday mornings.</p>

                <div class="columnHeading">Interclub/Wed Junior Club Nights</div>
                <div class="columnText">
					<p>Depending on age and ability, junior members may be at a suitable playing level to play interclub and/or attend our Wed junior club nights.
                    </p>

                    <p>Interclub players must be committed to be available to play all scheduled games in the pre and post Xmas season.
                    </p>                    

                    <p>As we want to ensure players enjoy interclub, inclusion in an interclub team is subject to the approval of the Junior committee who will consider the players age, ability, and also the overall numbers of players from the club and how many teams we can enter in the competition.
                    </p>

                    <p>Interclub trials may be held for some players where we are unsure of a player’s ability, or to ensure, where possible, the player gets placed in the appropriate team. Interclub usually starts late October and runs until early December. Post Xmas, it continues from around the 1st weekend of the school term (early Feb) to the end of March.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Interclub games usually start at either 8am or 10.30am each Saturday, and are played at courts throughout the Hutt Valley- schools, tennis clubs or Mitchell Park.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Interclub team practices are held each Tuesday afternoon from 4 to 7pm. Teams will be allocated a time slot once teams are finalised.
                    </p>

<p>
    Wednesday Junior Club nights are suitable for players who are close to, or have reached Interclub playing standard. There are 2 sessions, the first one starts at 5pm. Players enjoy organised games as well as learning court and team etiquette. These start after Daylight saving commences.</p>
